# Demo LLM with RAG

This is a demo project showcasing a Large Language Model (LLM) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project demonstrates how to utilize LLMs for advanced document retrieval and text generation tasks.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- SQLite >= 3.35
- Ollama (for LLM integration)

## Setting Up Locally
